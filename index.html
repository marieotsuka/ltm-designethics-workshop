# Overview:<br>What is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE?

---

# What is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE?

???
**R**

So first, what is low-tech magazine?

--

## “Doubts on progress and technology”

???
**R**

LTM is an on-line journal that casts doubts on progress and technology since 2007. The magazine was founded **Kris de Decker** who remains the main author. 

--

## Obsolete Technology

???
**R**

The magazine studies historical and obsolete technologies

--

## High-Tech Problems

???
**R**

- together with research into the social and environmental problems that result from the use of high technology

--

## Low-Tech Solutions

???
**R**

- and combines techniques of yesterday with knowledge of today to create low tech solutions.

--

## 12 articles a year, with 900,000 unique yearly visitors

???
**R**

- the magazine releases 12 long, well researched and richly illustrated **articles** each year 
- over the course of the years has received a **steady following**.
- which contribute to the community through lengthy and insightful commentary.

- the use of solar panels does not automatically make something sustainable

---
class: mix, bottom
background-image: url(img/chinese-greenhouse.png)

???
**R**
- architectural innovations
- such as how chinese solar greenhouses use non-glass material to be more energy-efficient


---

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/originalltm-index.png)

# 2007

???
**R**
- The original website was launched in 2007

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/oldltm-index.png)

# 2017

???
**R**
- ten years later, there was little change
- is in desparate need of a redesign
- not responsive

---

class: center, middle
#“If you are so low-tech,<br>then why do you have a website?”

???
**R**
- but people kept asking a question that was in need of a serious answer
- at the heart of this question are some assumptions about what low tech, is and isn't
- our answer to this, which looks like this

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/ltm-index.png)

# 2018

???
**R**
- is a result of interogating and approaching low-tech as a *process*, not as a static definition

---

class: section, center, middle

# What is Low-Tech?

---
class: center, middle
# Technique > Technology

???
**M**

- low-tech is about considering technique over technology
- technique is about how things are used, embedded or contextualized

---
# What is Low-Tech?
- ### energy impact

???
**M**

low tech considers energy impact

--

- ### built-in assumptions

???
**M**

but also the built in assumptions about use, reparability, maintenance etc

--

- ### dependencies

???
**M**

and it considers the dependencies of technologies, favoring less complex or less problematic dependency chains

---

# Why Low-Tech Web Design?

???
**M**

- immaterial internet
- growing energy use
- material basis of datacenters transport and computers
- renewables can but not enough
- energy use of internet grows faster

---

# Data Growth

![data growth chart](img/datagrowth.png)

???
**M**

- x3 and x10 on mobile
- more data means more energy use in transport
- but also means stronger and newer computers

---

# Why Low-Tech Web Design?


## Growth of data usage
* ### More transport
* ### Need for faster computers

--

## Always on-line

???
**M**

used to be desktop in office, library home

now even on-line when you sleep

--

* ### Cloud computing

???
**M**

what you used to do off-line now happens on-line

writing documents, listening to music etc
--

* ### More computing

???
**M**

multiple devices, internet of things etc

**conclusion** less data, less on-line

---

class: section
# How did solar.lowtechmagazine.com come about?

---

# Thinking with *hard limits*

???

*R* LTM is a public research project
do what you preach

---

background-image: url(img/solar-panel-solar-powered-server-2.png)

Use the pre-existing off-grid solar of LTM office]

???

Experiment to see if it can be done.

---

# Thinking with *hard limits*

## How off-grid solar?

???

How to provision for off-grid solar?

--

#### Don’t scale energy infra up, scale energy requirements down

???

Webhosting and web apps are about virtualization and scaling. There is no material. We need to do the opposite.

--

## Challenge the sanctity of “uptime”

--

#### What if instead of 99.99999% (“5 nines uptime”) we do 90%?

???
*R* With uptime comes redundancy. 

The exponential increase in resources needed to add another nine

This is anti-cloud and anti-scaling

Design can solve this much more elegantly than engineering

Our uptime was 98%

---

background-image: url(img/new-solar-charge-controller.png)

#### use extremely low-powered computer, max 1.3 W/h


???

*R* low-powered computer also necessary

---
background-image: url(img/new-solar-charge-controller.png)

#### your phone is faster (and uses more energy)

---
background-image: url(img/new-solar-charge-controller.png)

#### your last phone is also faster (and uses more energy)

???

audience cracks up or stays silent as they repulse in disgust at this sad joke

---

# Thinking with *hard limits*

--

## The site is too popular to use normal CMS on this machine

???

the hard limit on energy shifted our entire design

--

#### What if we don’t use modern web methods, but look at the past for inspiration?

???

dynamic site vs static site

--

## Website as documents rather than an app

???

generate the site in one go, rather than on every request

much easier to host, less risk of hacking, out of date versions

--

####  extremely fast, low-energy, works on old devices 

???

we get all these gifts for free as well

markdown means portable archive
we use Pelican because python then I could write extensions

# Design Strategies

???
**M**
- all of these constraints — these environmental and structrual conditions — became the parameters to develop a design most appropriate
- goal was to not only have a functional website, but have the design reveal this underlying infrastructure

---
# Low Data Footprint

## Compressed image size through dithering

???
**M**

- Must have low data footprint for the low-power machine to support
- Reduce size of media
- Automatic conversion was necessary due to the amount of existing article images

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/woodgas-vehicle.jpg)

# Original Image (99KB)


???
**M**

- Archival imagery of images

---
class: bottom, mix
background-image: url(img/woodgas-vehicle.png)
background-color: black

# Dithered Image (22KB)

???
**M**

- In our case, we wanted to communicate the act of compression
- Exaggerate materiality

---
class: bottom, mix
background-image: url(img/woodgas-vehicle.png)
background-color: #006951

# Colored Image (22KB)

???
**M**

- colors were used to provide more contrast, and communicate the content category

---
class: bottom, center
background-image: url(img/logo-original.png)

## Original Logotype

???
**M**

- No logo
- Use unicodes and fallbacks

---
class: middle, center

## New Logotype

# LOW←TECH MAGAZINE
← is a common symbol with a Unicode value of 2190

???
**M**

- Reduces the need to send assets around
- Adapts to its environment

---
# Default Fonts

![browser settings](img/browser.png)

???
**M**

- Reveal that the browser is an active agent in what you see ("User agent")
- Browser is part of the infrastructure

---

# Reduce Number of assets loaded

???
**M**

- In addition to reducing the media load, minimize the # of HTTP Requests

--
## No ads

--
## Inline SVGs

--
## Image Sprites

![sample image sprite](img/image-sprite.png)


???
- Other strategies: subsetting fonts
- loading a single variable font
- CSS vs. JS animations, CSS properties are suited for animations

---
# Benefits in accessibility

???
**M**
- There are added benefits to these moves: it improves the accessibility of the site

--
## Support for older browsers

???
**M**

--
## Support for slower internet connections

???
**M**

---
class: middle, center
# Infrastructure → Design

???
**M**
- The design of the site needed to communicate the way it works, and the way it was made
- Friction in user experience needed to be explained

---
class: bottom

![screenshot of battery](img/battery.png)

## Battery Meter


--
class: bottom

## Weather Forecast

???
**M**
Battery meter communicates the relationship of supply and demand of energy

#Off-line reading [options](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/offline-reading.html)

???
**M**
- we enable offline reading
- reading in printed form may be more sustainable than using a digital screen, depending on context
- print stylsheets enabled for individual articles, and printed book is published on-demand
- Lauren Traugott-Campbell designed the publication with a similar low-tech process

---
class: center, middle

# This is just one possible approach

## There are many other ways to do this!

???
**M**
- avoid trend to copy aesthetics
- the point of the site was to show how different choices can be made, we encourage everyone to do the same
- port existing website research in public

# How to design for (data&energy) sobriety?

???


**R** This should be about that, not aesthetics. Please be be creative. 

Gonna show to websites and how to consider how they are designed.

# <https://lowimpact.organicbasics.com>

???
**R**

- not to be moralistic, but to see what could work?
- Beware of greenwashing
- The idea is nice, but there is a logical fallacy of green energy, offsets etc. 
- In the end it comes down to how much bits do you push, how much calculations are made.

# Wrap-up: Questions
### What are the key questions we should ask<br> when making a sustainable website?

???
**Both?**

- What is the site material, content types & assets?
- How often will it be updated?
- Who updates the site?
- Who accesses the site?
- How “legible” is the site?
- Where are they located?
- How are we setting up the site to evolve? How do we maintain it?
- What kind of behaviors is the site encouraging people to do?

---
# Last Tips

## Consider your context
## Use different tools, both for developing and accessing the site (old machines, non-standard browsers)
## Follow “SEO Best Practices” not for SEO reasons, but for accessibility reasons
## Keep up with technological developments

???
**R**

- try making it not on a macbook. OR on your 15 year old one. If it works then, its probably light. Trying it on old phone. 
- Non-standard browsers
- Google  lighthouse / perf test 
- "SEO Tips" and performance best practices 
- low-tech does not mean you reject technology
- HTML is a language that is evolving, i.e. lazy loading tag
