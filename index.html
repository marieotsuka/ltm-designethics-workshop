# Overview:<br>What is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE?

---

# What is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE?

???
**M**

So first, what is low-tech magazine?

--

## “Doubts on progress and technology”

???
**M**

LTM is an on-line journal that casts doubts on progress and technology since 2007. The magazine was founded **Kris de Decker** who remains the main author. 

--

## Obsolete Technology

???
**M**

The magazine studies historical and obsolete technologies

--

## High-Tech Problems

???
**M**

- together with research into the social and environmental problems that result from the use of high technology

--

## Low-Tech Solutions

???
**M**

- and combines techniques of yesterday with knowledge of today to create low tech solutions.

--

## 12 articles a year, with 900,000 unique yearly visitors

???
**M**

- the magazine releases 12 long, well researched and richly illustrated **articles** each year 
- over the course of the years has received a **steady following**.
- which contribute to the community through lengthy and insightful commentary.

background-color: #d11305

#renewable energy

???
**M**
- it take a critical view of renewable energy
- the use of solar panels does not automatically make something sustainable

---
class: mix, bottom
background-image: url(img/chinese-greenhouse.png)

#buildings

???
**M**
- architectural innovations
- such as how chinese solar greenhouses use non-glass material to be more energy-efficient

#ICT

???
**M**

# 2007

???
**M**
- The original website was launched in 2007

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/oldltm-index.png)

# 2017

???
**M**
- ten years later, there was little change
- is in desparate need of a redesign
- not responsive

---

class: center, middle
#“If you are so low-tech,<br>then why do you have a website?”

???
**M**
- but people kept asking a question that was in need of a serious answer
- at the heart of this question are some assumptions about what low tech, is and isn't
- our answer to this, which looks like this

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/ltm-index.png)

# 2018

???
**M**
- is a result of interogating and approaching low-tech as a *process*, not as a static definition

---

# What is Low-Tech?

---
class: center, middle
# Technique > Technology

???
**R**

- low-tech is about considering technique over technology
- technique is about how things are used, embedded or contextualized

---
# What is Low-Tech?
- ### energy impact

???
**R**

low tech considers energy impact

--

- ### built-in assumptions

???
**R**

but also the built in assumptions about use, reparability, maintenance etc

--

- ### dependencies

???
**R**

and it considers the dependencies of technologies, favoring less complex or less problematic dependency chains

---

# Why Low-Tech Web Design?

???
**R**

- immaterial internet
- growing energy use
- material basis of datacenters transport and computers
- renewables can but not enough
- energy use of internet grows faster

---

# Data Growth

![data growth chart](img/datagrowth.png)

???
**R**

- x3 and x10 on mobile
- more data means more energy use in transport
- but also means stronger and newer computers

---

# Why Low-Tech Web Design?


## Growth of data usage
* ### More transport
* ### Need for faster computers

--

## Always on-line

???
**R**

used to be desktop in office, library home

now even on-line when you sleep

--

* ### Cloud computing

???
**R**

what you used to do off-line now happens on-line

writing documents, listening to music etc
--

* ### More computing

???
**R**

multiple devices, internet of things etc

**conclusion** less data, less on-line

# Strategies:<br>How is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE designed?

---

# What is a sustainable website?

---
class: center, middle

# No website

???
**R**

- the most sustainable is to have no website at all

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/www.png)
# The original website


???
**R**
- in the same way that Kris de Decker looks to technologies of the past, we looked at historical examples of websites for inspiration

---
# The case of solar.lowtechmagazine.com

## Approach informs the aesthetic, not vice-versa
## Determine the compromises: minimize footprint while designing engaging content

???
**R**
- it is not an aesthetic or a stylesheet but an approach
- website as a document rather than an app

---
class: section
# Hardware strategies

???
**R**

---
# XXX

???
**R**

have a 1w SBC. Not applicable to others. But the hard constraint can also be made. Webhosting and web apps are about virtualization. There is not material. 
anti-cloud anti-scaling

# Off-grid system

## Solar-powered server
## Barcelona, Spain

background-image: url(img/new-solar-charge-controller.png)

# Low-power machine

## Goal: 90% uptime, not 100%

---
# Expected Uptime

## XXX

???
**R**


---
# Static Website

## Markdown format stores content as portable archive
## Various static site generators are available

???
**R**
We chose Pelican because:
- working with existing data
- python based

---
class: section
# Design Strategies

???
**M**
- all of these constraints — these environmental and structrual conditions — became the parameters to develop a design most appropriate
- goal was to not only have a functional website, but have the design reveal this underlying infrastructure

---
# Low Data Footprint

## Compressed image size through dithering

???
**M**

- Must have low data footprint for the low-power machine to support
- Reduce size of media
- Automatic conversion was necessary due to the amount of existing article images

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/woodgas-vehicle.jpg)

# Original Image (99KB)


???
**M**

- Archival imagery of images

---
class: bottom, mix
background-image: url(img/woodgas-vehicle.png)
background-color: black

# Dithered Image (22KB)

???
**M**

- In our case, we wanted to communicate the act of compression
- Exaggerate materiality

---
class: bottom, mix
background-image: url(img/woodgas-vehicle.png)
background-color: #006951

# Colored Image (22KB)

???
**M**

- colors were used to provide more contrast, and communicate the content category

---
class: bottom, center
background-image: url(img/logo-original.png)

## Original Logotype

???
**M**

- No logo
- Use unicodes and fallbacks

---
class: middle, center

## New Logotype

# LOW←TECH MAGAZINE
← is a common symbol with a Unicode value of 2190

???
**M**

- Reduces the need to send assets around
- Adapts to its environment

---
# Default Fonts

???
**M**

- Reveal that the browser is an active agent in what you see ("User agent")
- Browser is part of the infrastructure

---

# Reduce Number of assets loaded

???
**M**

- In addition to reducing the media load, minimize the # of HTTP Requests

--
## No ads

--
## Inline SVGs

--
## Image Sprites

???
- Other strategies: subsetting fonts
- loading a single variable font
- CSS vs. JS animations, CSS properties are suited for animations

---
# Benefits in accessibility

???
**M**
- There are added benefits to these moves: it improves the accessibility of the site

--
## Support for older browsers

???
**M**

--
## Support for slower internet connections

???
**M**

#Off-line reading [options](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/offline-reading.html)

???
**M**
- we enable offline reading
- reading in printed form may be more sustainable than using a digital screen, depending on context
- print stylsheets enabled for individual articles, and printed book is published on-demand
- Lauren Traugott-Campbell designed the publication with a similar low-tech process

---

# Different Choices

## There are many other ways to do this!

???
**M**
- avoid trend to copy aesthetics
- the point of the site was to show how different choices can be made, we encourage everyone to do the same
- port existing website research in public

# Collective Wrapup: Questions
### What are the key questions we should ask when making a sustainable website?

???
**Both?**

- What is the site material, content types & assets?
- How often will it be updated?
- Who updates the site?
- Who accesses the site?
- How “legible” is the site?
- Where are they located?
- How are we setting up the site to evolve? How do we maintain it?
- What kind of behaviors is the site encouraging people to do?

---
# Last Tips

## Consider your context
## Use different tools, both for developing and accessing the site (old machines, non-standard browsers)
## Follow “SEO Best Practices” not for SEO reasons, but for accessibility reasons
## Keep up with technological developments

???
**R**

- try making it not on a macbook. OR on your 15 year old one. If it works then, its probably light. Trying it on old phone. 
- Non-standard browsers
- Google  lighthouse / perf test 
- "SEO Tips" and performance best practices 
- low-tech does not mean you reject technology
- HTML is a language that is evolving, i.e. lazy loading tag
