# Overview:<br>What is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE?

---

# What is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE?

???

So first, what is low-tech magazine?

--

## “Doubts on progress and technology”

???

LTM is an on-line journal that casts doubts on progress and technology since 2007. The magazine was founded **Kris de Decker** who remains the main author. 

--

## Obsolete Technology

???

The magazine studies historical and obsolete technologies

--

## High-Tech Problems

???

- together with research into the social and environmental problems that result from the use of high technology

--

## Low-Tech Solutions

???

- and combines techniques of yesterday with knowledge of today to create low tech solutions.

--

## 12 articles a year, with 900,000 unique yearly visitors

???

- the magazine releases 12 long, well researched and richly illustrated **articles** each year 
- over the course of the years has received a **steady following**.
- which contribute to the community through lengthy and insightful commentary.

# 2007

???
- The website was launched in 2007

---

background-image: url(img/ltm-index.png)

# 2019

???
- And saw little change so far
- is in desparate need of a redesign
- for one it is completely unfit for mobile phones

class: center, middle
#“If you are so low-tech,<br>then why do you have a website?”

???

- but people kept asking a question that was in need of a serious answer
- at the heart of this question are some assumptions about what low tech is and isn't


---

class: center, middle

# What is Low-Tech?

---
class: center, middle
# technique > technology

???

- low-tech is about considering technique over technology
- technique is about how things are used, embedded or contextualized

---
# What is Low-Tech?
- ### energy impact

???

low tech considers energy impact

--

- ### built-in assumptions

???

but also the built in assu  mptions about use, reparability, maintenance etc

--

- ### dependencies

???

and it considers the dependencies of technologies, favoring less complex or less problematic dependency chains

---
# Useful concepts

- ### affordances
- ### externalities
- ### rebound effects

???

i want to quickly dive into three concepts that are helpful when thinking about how to take a low-tech approach

---

# Affordances

## “**the range of functions and constraints that an object provides for, and places upon**, structurally situated subjects”

Davis, Jenny L., and James B. Chouinard. 2016. “Theorizing Affordances: From Request to Refuse.” Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society 36(4): 241–48.

???

- translate from academic to plain english
- steering, not deterministic
- guns kill people, toaster doesn't 
- working with affordance is your one of your tools as a designer
- car can go fast or slow, 
- your choice but nice sounds, looks

- the rules allow you to go 130 
- the road is nice and straight
- free choice but influenced by culture, structures, laws that have influence on your choice

---
# (Negative) Externalities

## the manufacture and use of things has (negative) impacts on others, who have not chosen to use the product but who end up bearing the costs. For example the environment.

Goodstein, Eban S. 2012. Economics and the Environment. Wiley.

???

- economics, costs or benefits not taking into account of pricing. 
- car example, pollution, increased stress of other drivers, increased stress for road
- none of this is in the price of the car.

---

# Rebound effects

## If something becomes more energy efficient and thus cheaper, we can use more of it!

Herring, Horace, and Robin Roy. 2007. “Technological Innovation, Energy Efficient Design and the Rebound Effect.” Technovation 27(4): 194–203.


???

- environmental economics 
- fuel efficiency leads to more driving
- jevon's paradox: increased efficiency of a resource use leads to increased demand and more consumption
- imagine using efficiency gains not to produce more but to reduce negative externalities

---

# Why Low-Tech Web Design?

???

- immaterial internet
- growing energy use
- material basis of datacenters transport and computers
- renewables can but not enough
- energy use of internet grows faster

---
# data img
background-image: url(img/datagrowth.png)

???

- x3 and x10 on mobile
- more data means more energy use in transport
- but also means stronger and newer computers

---

# Why Low-Tech Web Design?

## Growth of data usage
* ### More transport
* ### Need for faster computers

--

## Always on-line

???

used to be desktop in office, library home

now even on-line when you sleep

--

* ### Cloud computing

???

what you used to do off-line now happens on-line

writing documents, listening to music etc
--

* ### More computing

???
multiple devices, internet of things etc

**conclusion** less data, less on-line

# Strategies:<br>How is LOW←TECH MAGAZINE designed?

---

# What is a sustainable website?

---
class: center, middle

# No website

???
- the most sustainable is to have no website at all

---
class: bottom
background-image: url(img/www.png)
# The original website


???
- in the same way that Kris de Decker looks to technologies of the past, we looked at historical examples of websites for inspiration

---
# The case of solar.lowtechmagazine.com

## Approach informs the aesthetic, not vice-versa
## Determine the compromises: minimize footprint while designing engaging content

???
- it is not an aesthetic or a stylesheet but an approach
- website as a document rather than an app

# Off-grid system

## Solar-powered server
## Barcelona, Spain

---
background-image: url(img/new-solar-charge-controller.png)

# Low-power machine

## Goal: 90% uptime, not 100%

---

# Low Data Footprint

## Compressed image size through dithering
## Simplified logotype into typographic move
## Use default fonts available on system

???
- Reduce size of media
- In our case, we wanted to communicate the act of compression
- Reveal that the browser is an active agent in what you see ("User agent")
- Communicate materiality

---

# Reduce Number of assets loaded

## No ads
## Inline SVGs
## Image Sprites

???
- In addition to reducing the media load, minimize the # of HTTP Requests
- Other strategies: subsetting fonts
- loading a single variable font
- CSS vs. JS animations, CSS properties are suited for animations

---
# Static Website

## Markdown format stores content as portable archive
## Various static site generators are available

???
We chose Pelican because:

---
# Accessibility

## Support for older borwsers
## Support for slower internet connections

---

# Hardware strategies

???
have a 1w SBC. Not applicable to others. But the hard constraint can also be made. Webhosting and web apps are about virtualization. There is not material. 
anti-cloud anti-scaling

---

background-image: url(img/lowtech-book.png)

#Off-line reading 

---

# Different Choices

## There are many other ways to do this!

???
- reverse trend 
- the point of the site was to show how different choices can be made, we encourage everyone to do the same
- port existing website research in public

---

# Workshop:<br>What is unsustainable about current websites?

---
# Case 1: 


???
- Beware of greenwashing

---
# Case 2: 

???
-

---
class: middle, center
# Let’s look at a couple websites together


---
class: middle, center

# Pair Brainstorm
### Pick any website and speculate what a more<br> sustainable approach might be
### [MURAL Link](https://app.mural.co/t/ethicsbydesign20204074/m/ethicsbydesign20204074/1601032493046/e62aa140c1e82d20b4de080eea2a9e7c91132899)
### *15min*
---
class: section

# Discussion:<br>How might we redesign these websites?

---
class: middle, center

# Share
### Presentation from teams on their findings
### *20min*

---
class: middle, center

# Collective Brainstorm
### What are the key questions we should ask?

???
- What is the site material, content types & assets?
- How often will it be updated?
- Who updates the site?
- Who accesses the site?
- How “legible” is the site?
- Where are they located?
- How are we setting up the site to evolve? How do we maintain it?
- What kind of behaviors is the site encouraging people to do?

---
# Concluding strategies

## Consider your context
## Use different tools, both for developing and accessing the site (old computers, non-standard browsers)
## Follow “SEO Best Practices” not for SEO reasons, but for accessibility reasons
## Keep up with technological developments

???
- try making it not on a macbook. OR on your 15 year old one. If it works then, its probably light. Trying it on old phone. 
- Non-standard browsers
- Google  lighthouse / perf test 
- "SEO Tips" and performance best practices 
- low-tech does not mean you reject technology
- HTML is a language that is evolving, i.e. lazy loading tag
